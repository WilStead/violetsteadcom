In the United States, 1 in 6 couples struggle to conceive. After a miscarriage and struggles to get pregnant again, we, Jessi and Wil, decided to seek out the help of a fertility clinic. We were thrilled to partner with the [Florida Institute for Reproductive Medicine (FIRM)](https://www.fertilityjacksonville.com). Working with FIRM was a wonderful experience for us. After two surgeries, countless medications, and two rounds of In-Utero Insemination (IUI), we found out we were expecting little Violet. During this process, we discovered 33% of fertility struggles are related to female reproductive issues, 33% of fertility struggles are related to male reproductive issues, and 33% of fertility struggles are unknown. Hearing the words, "We don't know why you can't conceive." can be heartbreaking. So many couples have to hear these words, including ourselves. With the support of our family and friends, we bravely entered into our journey with FIRM. Through our faith, prayer, and lots of patience, we took things one step at a time and were thrilled to see that positive test in July 2019.
