Nana was full of life and love for her family. She lived an exciting life full of many great adventures and loved her family. Although she preferred to go by Jane, we know she'd be honored to have Violet as her namesake.

Grandmother was a spitfire, sassy, loving and generous gal who looked over her family like any great matriarch would do! She loved life, loved a good game of Black Jack and loved a sweet southern whiskey. At the age of 18 Grandmother changed her name from <span class="muted">[unspoken]</span> to Ima Jean, but never once went by Ima as she preferred to pay homage herself to her beloved Uncle Gene. Violet is the third generation in our family to take the name Jean as a middle name.
