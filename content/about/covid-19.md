In March of 2020, [Covid-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) had begun to run rampant in the United States. It was clear things were very serious and by mid-march a state-wide "stay at home" order was put in place for the state of Florida, where we live. I, Jessi, was due on April 5. On March 16, Wil and I began working from home and self-quarantining along with the rest of the state. Wil works from home anyway but he usually went into the office, located in Daytona, one day a week. The week before he had stopped going into the office as I was nearing my due date. On March 22, after 6 days of quarantining, my water broke around 10:45AM. Off to the hospital we went. Because things had just started to get very strict at the hospital, only Wil was permitted to go with me and we were not allowed any visitors. Labor and Delivery was the only floor of the hospital where patients were permitted one guest and it had to be the father or other parent of the baby. We were crushed. I had wanted my mom in the room with me when Violet was born, especially since this was her very first grandchild. The doctors and nurses at Baptist Medical Center in downtown Jacksonville were wonderful. Many safety precautions were taken, everyone was careful, and we were very well taken care of. After 37 hours of labor it was clear I was not progressing so I had a caesarian section and Violet was brought into the world at 1:16AM on Tuesday, March 24. 

But our Covid-19 birth story does not end there. After 5 days in the hospital we begged our doctors to send us home. Despite the fact that I was still having on again, off again, blood pressure spikes, we were sent home with very strict instructions about monitoring my blood pressure. Two days after coming home I was readmitted to the hospital with complications from preeclampsia. My blood pressure was dangerously high and I had fluid on my lungs. Unfortunately, fluid on the lungs was also a symptom of Covid-19. Because of this the hospital could not take any risks. I was tested for Covid and placed on a floor in the hospital with other patients experiencing symptoms and waiting for test results. I had no symptoms and was treated with medication for preeclampsia. Very quickly, it was clear I was suffering from preeclampsia and not Covid-19. The medication I received worked immediately and I was sent home the next day feeling a million times better. Two days after coming home I was officially given a negative Covid test result.
