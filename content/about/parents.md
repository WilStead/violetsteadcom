My parents are Wil and Jessi.

Jessi is an Ordained Minister of Word and Sacrament in the [Presbyterian Church U.S.A.](https://www.pcusa.org) She serves as the Parish Associate of [St. Giles Presbyterian Church](https://stgilesfl.org) in Orange Park, Florida. Jessi loves cooking, reading, crime dramas, [The Sims](https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims), and of course, Wil and Violet.

We can't forget the most beloved family member, Ella, our adorable dachshund mix pup. Violet recently discovered Ella, much to Ella's dismay. We are hoping these two will become the best of friends.
